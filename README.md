# Advent of Code 2023

My solitions for Advent of Code 2023 programming puzzles. The solutions are in Python.

I haven't participated in Advent of Code in previous years, but this year I decided to try to solve at least some of the puzzles. I chose Python because it's been a few years since I last used it and I thought solving problems with Python would be a good refresher.
